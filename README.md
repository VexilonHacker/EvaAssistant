```bash
git clone https://github.com/VexilonHacker/EvaAssistant && cd EvaAssistant
```

- for __[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)__ manager "which can be up to 10x faster than pip" : 
    ```bash
    uv sync
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
- for pip manager :
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- system requirements:
    - Ollama (for running local LLMs):
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S ollama # for arch based distros
    curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh  # for other linux distros

    ```
    - then run and checkout [Ollama Benchmarks Results](Benchmarks/ollama_benchmark_results.txt):
    ```bash
        ollama pull tinydolphin
        ollama pull gurubot/phi3-mini-abliterated 
        ollama pull huihui_ai/phi4-mini-abliterated 
        ollama pull gemma3 
        # for models that have been tested 
        """
        tinydolphin: very fast response but less accurate
        gurubot/phi3-mini-abliterated: medium speed but accurate + uncensored 
        huihui_ai/phi4-mini-abliterated: medium speed and accurate but best of all + uncensored (Default)
        gemma3: Slow but provides more accurate responses
        """
    ```
    - You can change the default model by editing the **model** variable in the **main** function in __[EvaAssistant.py](EvaAssistant.py)__
    ```python
    def main():
        global  assistant_name
        TestInputSound = False
        assistant_name = 'Eva'
        DisableErrorMsgs()
        # for models that have been tested 
        """
        tinydolphin: very fast response but less accurate
        gurubot/phi3-mini-abliterated: medium speed but accurate 
        huihui_ai/phi4-mini-abliterated: medium speed and accurate but best of all: uncensored (Default)
        gemma3: Slow but provide more accurate
        """
        # model = "gemma3"
        # model = "tinydolphin"
        model = "huihui_ai/phi4-mini-abliterated"
        output_wav = '.micro.wav'
        speech_wav = '.output.wav'
    ```

    - Physlock (for locking the screen):
    ```bash
    sudo apt install physlock # debian based distros
    sudo pacman -S physlock # for arch based distros
    ```

## ðŸ§ª Test the Setup:
After starting __`EvaAssistant.py`__, try saying:
```text
Eva, explain quantum physics 
```
If Eva responds correctly, your setup is working!

## ðŸ§© General Voice Command 
- Open browser and search query:
    ```bash
    Eva, search for [query]
    ```
